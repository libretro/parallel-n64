/*
 * Use three procedures for standard integer type definitions from C.
 *     1.  If compiling with MSVC, use Microsoft's LLP64 fixed-size types.
 *         If it's not a Microsoft compiler, it isn't using the LLP64 model.
 *     2.  If C99 or later support is found, attempt to #include <stdint.h>
 *         and to use possible C99 type definitions.  The above method for
 *         MSFT compilers has the pro of not raising subtle C89 warnings.
 *     3.  If C99 support was not found, hope for a LP64 model and the best.
 *         Even C89 regulates that short >= 16b; int >= 16b; long >= 32b.
